## üß™ Test Methods

### Method 1: Manual Test (Without Email)

Test the API directly first:

```powershell
# Test from your machine
$body = @{
    source = "email"
    text = "Hi, I need a professional website for my restaurant business. We have a budget ready and need it done within 2 months. Can you help?"
    subject = "Website Development Inquiry"
    external_id = "test-manual-001"
    contact = @{
        email = "testcustomer@example.com"
        name = "Test Customer"
    }
    meta = @{
        receivedAt = (Get-Date).ToString("o")
    }
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5173/api/inbound/email" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "leadId": "uuid-here",
  "clientId": "uuid-here",
  "intent": "sales",
  "urgency": "medium",
  "urgency_score": 65,
  "sentiment": "positive",
  ...
}
```

### Method 2: Test with Real Email

#### A. Send Test Email

Send an email to the email account you configured:

**To:** your-monitored-email@gmail.com
**Subject:** Website Inquiry - Test
**Body:**
```
Hello,

I'm interested in getting a new website built for my business. 
We need an e-commerce platform with payment integration.
Our budget is $5000 and we'd like to launch within 3 months.

Can you provide a quote?

Thanks!
John Doe
```

#### B. Wait for Processing

- Default poll interval: **Every 1 minute**
- Wait 1-2 minutes after sending the email
- Watch n8n for execution

#### C. Monitor Execution

In n8n:
1. Click **"Executions"** in the left sidebar
2. You should see a new execution appear
3. Click on it to see details
4. All nodes should show **green checkmarks** ‚úÖ

### Method 3: Test Using n8n's "Test Workflow" Feature

1. Open the workflow in n8n
2. Click **"Test Workflow"** button (top right)
3. Click the **"Email Trigger (IMAP)"** node
4. Click **"Fetch Test Event"**
5. n8n will fetch the most recent email
6. Click **"Execute Node"** to process it
7. Check each node's output

## üìä Verification Steps

### 1. Check n8n Execution Logs

In n8n Executions tab:
- ‚úÖ Status should be **"Success"** (green)
- ‚úÖ All nodes completed successfully
- ‚úÖ "Send to Server" node shows API response

### 2. Check Docker Logs

```powershell
# View Inbox Pilot logs
docker-compose logs -f inbox-pilot

# Look for:
# - Incoming POST to /api/inbound/email
# - AI classification results
# - Success response
```

### 3. Check Supabase Database

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Table Editor**
3. Open **`leads`** table
4. You should see a new record with:
   - ‚úÖ `raw_text`: Your email content
   - ‚úÖ `subject`: Email subject
   - ‚úÖ `source`: "email"
   - ‚úÖ `intent`: AI classification (sales/support/spam)
   - ‚úÖ `urgency`: Urgency level (low/medium/high/critical)
   - ‚úÖ `urgency_score`: Numeric score
   - ‚úÖ `sentiment`: Sentiment analysis
   - ‚úÖ `client_id`: UUID linking to client
   - ‚úÖ `external_id`: Email message ID

4. Open **`clients`** table
5. You should see a client record with the sender's email

### 4. Check Inbox Pilot Dashboard

1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Navigate to **Dashboard** or **Leads** page
3. Your test lead should appear with:
   - Intent badge (sales/support/spam)
   - Urgency indicator
   - Sentiment
   - Client information

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: Workflow Not Triggering

**Check:**
```powershell
# Is n8n running?
docker-compose ps n8n

# Is workflow active?
# Check in n8n UI - toggle should be green/ON
```

**Solution:**
- Make sure workflow is saved and activated
- Check email arrived in monitored mailbox
- Check IMAP credentials are correct
- Wait for next poll cycle (1 minute)

### Issue: "Connection Refused" Error

**Problem:** n8n can't reach Inbox Pilot

**Check URL in "Send to Server" node:**
- ‚úÖ Correct: `http://inbox-pilot:5173/api/inbound/email`
- ‚ùå Wrong: `http://localhost:5173/api/inbound/email`

**Verify both containers are running:**
```powershell
docker-compose ps
```

### Issue: Authentication Error (401)

**If you see HTTP 401:**
1. Set Authentication to **"None"** in "Send to Server" node
2. Your API doesn't require auth by default

### Issue: Empty Email Body

**If text is empty in database:**
- Some emails are HTML-only
- The workflow extracts text from HTML
- Check raw_text field in database

### Issue: Email Not Being Fetched

**Check IMAP credentials:**
```powershell
# View n8n logs
docker-compose logs -f n8n

# Look for IMAP connection errors
```

**Common fixes:**
- Use App Password (Gmail requires this)
- Enable IMAP in email settings
- Check firewall/antivirus isn't blocking

### Issue: Lead Created but No AI Classification

**Check environment variables:**
```powershell
# Check if HF token is set
docker-compose exec inbox-pilot printenv | grep HF
```

**If missing, update .env and restart:**
```powershell
# Edit .env file with real HF token
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

## üìà Testing Different Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Sales Lead (High Urgency)
**Email:**

```
**Expected:**
- Intent: sales
- Urgency: high/critical
- Sentiment: neutral/positive

- Urgency: medium
- Sentiment: neutral

### Test Case 3: Spam
**Email:**
```
Subject: Congratulations! You won!

### Test Case 4: Deduplication
**Action:**
1. Send the same email twice
2. Both should be processed by n8n
3. Only ONE lead should be created (dedup by external_id)
